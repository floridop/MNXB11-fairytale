 Findings : A collaborative story
-------------------------------------------

"I think we're done here" - said Xa-aX while returning in her pocket
the TikTok Broadcaster after recording the report. 

The TikTok Broadcaster is used for measuring and attracting stars and
galaxies. It also makes a chirp sound while shutting down.

As she was doing so, a sudden ray of lighting reflected over the 
Fox Interstellar News logo on the device, blasting instant light on 
Zo-oZ's eyes still wide open with terror. Fox Interstellar is the company 
responsible for measuring and reporting on changes in the universe. 

"I don't want to believe what we've just seen" - said Zo-oZ - "I hope I will 
manage to get some sleep tonight..."

"I will" - replied Xa-aX - " it ain't the first time I record this 
stuff. I thought you said you were used to it!"

Even though Xa-aX tried to be brave, she knew that this one was the 
worst yet. She wanted to put on a brave face though.

"Did I say...? Oh sure, sure! I've seen this before, no problem!" - 
answered Zo-oZ in a mix of shame and confusion.


They continue their conversation...
"Was it werid that you had seen it before, what is your feeling when you first witnessed it?"
"Of course i am scared at first, i do not want to experience that once again if i can choose."
The Instaporter act as a PR in instagram that manage the user's quality and make sure the atmosphere in instgram is positive enough.

As they stepped into the company's instaporter, Zo-oZ nervously took his space and pressed the botton on the instaporter which would take them
back to the headquarters of the Fox Interstellar News Corporation in
New York City. Cold sweats ran down his face. Zo-oZ had a few minutes to reflect on the situation he found himself in right now. He wondered how Xa-aX had managed to 
keep her cool in the face of what they had just witnessed at the 
press room of the Johnson Space Center in Houston.


Something about Xa-aX's behavior was a little bit unsettling, and he was starting to feel like something was wrong.

Then they were met with their boss, Yn-nY, who appeared to be distraught in some manner. "I'm glad you're back this is urgent" - said Yn-nY.

Walking down the corridor towards Yn-nY's office, Xa-aX TikTok Brodcaster starts ringing. "Is it supposed to do that?" - said Zo-oZ.

"This have never happend before" - replied Xa-aX.

"Quickly! Destroy it! - yelled Yn-nY.

Without hesitating Xa-aX slammed it in the ground, shattering the device. "What is going on?!" - asked Zo-oZ, whilst still trying to keep it together. 

"This is way above our paygrade" - replied Yn-nY - "You must leave now and speak of this to no one!"

Alarms went off everywhere, guards started screaming like monkeys...

Before this story was even written, there lived a certain man, in Russia long ago. He was
big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow.

Most people look at him with terror and with fear, but to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear. 

This man lived 200 years before this story happened, he was an inventor and he was inspired by Tesla and Einstein in order to pursue his vision of perfect humankind. However, he was a narcisist and he was unable to content his anger. 

Most people look at him with terror and with fear.
