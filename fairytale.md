# The Misterious Artifact: A collaborative story
------------------------------------

Although many had tried, no one succeded again. The Artifact remained unopened, and yet to be discovered was the mistery of its content. 
Until that day, the day when everything changed, and the Fire nation attacked. 

It was actually not just one day. It was many, in many different parallel universes, all happening at the same time. 

The interdimensional journey begins to the best of our knowledge in the year 30 AD with the execution of Jesus of Nazareth by Pontius Pilate. The journey is that of mystery and great confusion for our characters in 1930s Moscow 

The interdimensional journey began on a friday. 
The Artifact was shining particularly bright that evening.
Bengt, one of the local blacksmiths, approached the Artifact.
He pulled out his axe and swung it, with all the power he had left, towards the Artifact...
The big, dark artifact...
And Bengt was sucked into the artifact.

Now is the year of 2530
Peter dropped several drops of sauce on the Artifact when he ate chicken dumplings. He was in a panic since his father Andrey had warned him not touch it. But Peter noticed that an imperceptible crack appeared. The Artifact was like a bottle but with heavy and thick sealing wax. 

Peter told his father. Andrey seemed incredible. Since this Artifact handed down by the ancestors of his family and had a history of more than 500 years, the sealing wax was hardly removed. Now no one knew what was inside and how could people open it intact. 

This crack looked like an opportunity. Andrey tried to remove the wax rely on this crack. How easily the wax was removed with the secrect sauce! The father and son removed the sealing wax by spreading their sauce.

The Artifact showed  true appearance -- a semitransparent bottle filled with deep brown liquid. Andrey opened the bottle and smelled. 'Oh rice vinegar!' He shouted. Rice vinegar was a kind of sauce that has a history of more than 3000 years in East Asia, but gradually disappeared in the 24rd century due to the problem of rice types.

'My grandmother told me before that she had tasted the rice vinegar when she was 10. Unfortunally, she never saw this brown, awesome, fragrant liquid any longer. Rumour has it that over time, rice vinegar will become more and more mellow...' Andrey said.

Peter could not wait. He have already poured out the vinegar and dipped the dumplings.

Andrey did not stop him. He remembered that his grandmother had said that there were several Artifacts like this before, but only this one was left after she was 10 years old. It is said that no one can open this last bottle perfectly.  It turned out that the Artifacts stored the rice vinegar. The sealing wax cracked when met Peter's sauce, probably because of some substance in the sauce.

So, he also boiled dumplings, and together with his son Peter,  tasted the dumplings with this bottle of rice vinegar that had been stored for half a century.

After they finished the dumplings and the full bottle of rice, they realised that on that day, they tried for the first and last time in their lives the oldest rice vinegar existing in the whole world. 

Suddenly, Peter started to feel his stomach cramping. He was shouting for his father, while the cramps were getting worse every second. Andrey was worried, he did not how to help his son. He thought, that they should have been more carefull with the vinegar.

... it was actually not just one day. It was many, in many
different parallel universes, all happening at the same time.
The interdimensional journey begins...

...on a friday. The Artifact was shining particularly bright this evening.
Bengt, one of the local blacksmiths, approached the Artifact.
He pulled out his axe and swung it, with all the power he had left, towards the Artifact...

...But just in the nick of time, Peter clad in iron armour, threw himself in the way of the axe and saved the Artifact without sustaining any damage. The blacksmith Bengt explained that he had been under a spell enticing him to destroy the Artifact. But who would cast such a spell?....

Not much later, an eerie woman with enchanting green eyes and a wicked laugh whilst carrying a decorated big book and wearing everso pointed hat appeared in front the household. The mysterious and magical nature of the Artifact was revealed to the people - although it was up to them to choose to believe it. According to this 'witch', the Artifact is in reality a substance that can be altered into a liquid of any kind, property or quality - one's imagination is the limit. But, for such a great feat certain trials needed to be completed. And so the blood-filled and treacherous adventure begins ...

Although no one lived to tell the tale a blurry image was found that is rumored to depict **The Artifact**

__An image that is roumored to depict the artifact__

... In another parrallel universe, rumor tells that the origin and purpose of this artifact.
It was made by an ancient sorserer, To open when the kingdom was in greatest need.
Yet although the kingdom has been plaged with many tragidies over the centuries,
the Artifact has remained subbornly closed.

On a picefull morning in grimholde, when the first beams of sun has just started to peek over 
the eastern mountain tops to, however early in the morning it was, you could already see
a boy leaveing the farmhouse on the outscurts of the village heading to the
forest in the north...

This boy ventured into the forest toward the sorcerer's tower because his mother was dying of a mysterious disease. He hoped that the sorcerer would be able to cure his mother,
and after a long journey he finally got to the tower. The tower's doors refused to open for him and the boy started wondering if it had all been for nothing. As the boy started to leave, the 
tower opened up before him and he saw the sorcerer. The ancient sorcerer told him of an Artifact of great power, and explained that his mother's disease could ruin the entire kingdom. But what the boy
learned next shocked him...

He learned that the artifact : palantir (PLTR), for so it was called, was not the wise investment he had been told; and so he decided to stop being a bagholder and -- 
insteaded shorted the accursed trinket which sent him to the moon; and all his financial troubles came to an end. Lo, thus spake the palantir : 

"Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm, I've been kicked around
Since I was born
And now it's alright, it's okay
And you may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive"

And so, what the artifact foretold came to be, the snake faced queen of three-in-one whomst is deigned with the syllables AYEM AE SEHTI AE VEHK, bore fruit to the warrior poet Vehk -- whom would be been known to the Velothi as the tribune Vivec. The ending of the words is ALMSIVI.  

The snake faced queen completely ate the Artifact. The sauce started pouring down the table and flooded the house.
