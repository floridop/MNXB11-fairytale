# The Misterious Artifact: A collaborative story
------------------------------------

Although many had tried, no one succeded again. 
The Artifact remained unopened, 
and yet to be discovered was the mistery of its content. Until one day...


Now is the year of 2530
Peter dropped several drops of sauce on the Artifact when he ate chicken dumplings. He was in a panic since his father Andrey had warned him not touch it. But Peter noticed that an imperceptible crack appeared. The Artifact was like a bottle but with heavy and thick sealing wax. 

Peter told his father. Andrey seemed incredible. Since this Artifact handed down by the ancestors of his family and had a history of more than 500 years, the sealing wax was hardly removed. Now no one knew what was inside and how could people open it intact. 

This crack looked like an opportunity. Andrey tried to remove the wax rely on this crack. How easily the wax was removed with the secrect sauce! The father and son removed the sealing wax by spreading their sauce.

The Artifact showed  true appearance -- a semitransparent bottle filled with deep brown liquid. Andrey opened the bottle and smelled. 'Oh rice vinegar!' He shouted. Rice vinegar was a kind of sauce that has a history of more than 3000 years in East Asia, but gradually disappeared in the 24rd century due to the problem of rice types.

'My grandmother told me before that she had tasted the rice vinegar when she was 10. Unfortunally, she never saw this brown, awesome, fragrant liquid any longer. Rumour has it that over time, rice vinegar will become more and more mellow...' Andrey said.

Peter could not wait. He have already poured out the vinegar and dipped the dumplings.

Andrey did not stop him. He remembered that his grandmother had said that there were several Artifacts like this before, but only this one was left after she was 10 years old. It is said that no one can open this last bottle perfectly.  It turned out that the Artifacts stored the rice vinegar. The sealing wax cracked when met Peter's sauce, probably because of some substance in the sauce.

So, he also boiled dumplings, and together with his son Peter,  tasted the dumplings with this bottle of rice vinegar that had been stored for half a century.

... it was actually not just one day. It was many, in many
different parallel universes, all happening at the same time.
The interdimensional journey begins...

...on a friday. The Artifact was shining particularly bright this evening.
Bengt, one of the local blacksmiths, approached the Artifact.
He pulled out his axe and swung it, with all the power he had left, towards the Artifact...

...striking it with the precision expected of one who spends all day beating metal. At this precise moment, the Artifact, as if releasing a great quantity of energy, rose up, enveloped itself in a blinding light surrounded by a choir of some angelic nature, and sent a stunned Bengt staggering backwards, looking on as the Artifact began to reveal the clandestine contents of its nigh-unbreakable shell: an exact replica of itself, except roughly four percent smaller. Bengt, now with permanent cataracts burned into his eyes, stepped towards it.
