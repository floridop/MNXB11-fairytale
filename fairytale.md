"I think we're done here" - said Xa-aX while returning in her pocket
the TikTok Broadcaster after recording the report. 

As she was doing so, a sudden ray of lighting reflected over the 
Fox Interstellar News logo on the device, blasting instant light on 
Zo-oZ's terrified expression. 

"I can believe what we've just seen" - said Zo-oZ - "I hope I will 
manage to get some sleep tonight..."

"I will" - replied Xa-aX - " it ain't the first time I record this 
stuff. I thought you said you were used to it!"

"Did I say...? Oh sure, sure! I've seen this before, no problem!" - 
answered Zo-oZ in a mix of shame and confusion.

As they stepped into the company's instaporter...

Xa-aX tripped, with the TikTok Broadcaster in her pocket falling out 
and breaking. Zo-oZ was in shock -- all of their hard work getting 
footage for content was just lost!
