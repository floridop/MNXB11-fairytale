 Findings : A collaborative story

"I think we're done here" - said Xa-aX while returning in her pocket
the TikTok Broadcaster after recording the report. 

The TikTok Broadcaster is used for measuring and attracting stars and
galaxies. It also makes a chirp sound while shutting down.

As she was doing so, a sudden ray of lighting reflected over the 
Fox Interstellar News logo on the device, blasting instant light on 
Zo-oZ's eyes still wide open with terror. Fox Interstellar is the company 
responsible for measuring and reporting on changes in the universe. 

"I don't want to believe what we've just seen" - said Zo-oZ - "I hope I will 
manage to get some sleep tonight..."

"I will" - replied Xa-aX - " it ain't the first time I record this 
stuff. I thought you said you were used to it!"

Even though Xa-aX tried to be brave, she knew that this one was the 
worst yet. She wanted to put on a brave face though.

"Did I say...? Oh sure, sure! I've seen this before, no problem!" - 
answered Zo-oZ in a mix of shame and confusion.
