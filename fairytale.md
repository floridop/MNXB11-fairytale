 Findings : A collaborative story

"I think we're done here" - said Xa-aX while returning in her pocket
the TikTok Broadcaster after recording the report. 

The TikTok Broadcaster is used for measuring and attracting stars and
galaxies. It also makes a chirp sound while shutting down.

As she was doing so, a sudden ray of lighting reflected over the 
Fox Interstellar News logo on the device, blasting instant light on 
Zo-oZ's eyes still wide open with terror. Fox Interstellar is the company 
responsible for measuring and reporting on changes in the universe. 

"I don't want to believe what we've just seen" - said Zo-oZ - "I hope I will 
manage to get some sleep tonight..."

"I will" - replied Xa-aX - " it ain't the first time I record this 
stuff. I thought you said you were used to it!"

Even though Xa-aX tried to be brave, she knew that this one was the 
worst yet. She wanted to put on a brave face though.

"Did I say...? Oh sure, sure! I've seen this before, no problem!" - 
answered Zo-oZ in a mix of shame and confusion.

As they stepped into the company's instaporter, which would take them
back to the headquarters of the Fox Interstellar News Corporation in
New York City, Zo-oZ had a few minutes to reflect on the situation 
he found himself in right now. He wondered how Xa-aX had managed to 
keep her cool in the face of what they had just witnessed at the 
press room of the Johnson Space Center in Houston.

Xa-aX tripped, with the TikTok Broadcaster in her pocket falling out 
and breaking. Zo-oZ was in shock -- all of their hard work getting 
footage for content was just lost!

There once lived a man, in Russia long ago, before this story was even
written
