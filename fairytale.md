 Burning SailWheels : A collaborative story
-------------------------------------------

They could see the sandstorm approaching on the horizon as the noon sun
started to hit its 52+ degrees out there.

From the top of Gerda Hill the WheatherShield started charging, converging 
its rays into a semisphere that would protect the area for a radius of 50km. 

A view only possible from Finn hill some 20km away from the other
hill, were the SailTyres bar stood. A must stop for all the Wheelsailers
of the area.

"Do you think it will hiccup again this time?"

"I really hope it won't, this windstorm is going to be memorable. Expect
the weirdest stuff to fly around"

The weather had been like that for almost 20 years after the waters
retired, leaving large acres of land as a desert, and only
hills here and there where populated by living creatures, biological or not.

Water powered energy was a thing of the past. Only the unresting sun
and the terrible winds were left.

As the tickness of the sandstorm made the sky dark, they didn't 
really realize what shape the last shadow casted on the windows 
of the bar.

Last scream they heard was a "WHAT THE H-" by the sweaty guy sitting by
the window. That's when a full-fledged container truck from the
pre-dry era fell from the sky smashing the bar at a crazy speed
destroying half of the building.

It happened again. The WheatherShield shut down for a moment, and
just for enough time for the extraordinary object to close the
establishment for an undefinite amount of time.

Murray was still frantically messing up with his Sailwheel control
panel when he saw the whole event unfolding in front of his eyes.
Saving these people was not exactly their business. They weren't 
there for the bar either.

"Well" - they thought - "I guess it's really time to go check that
Weathershield now"

Sealed the airlock, opened the Sail, and the wheels screamed
as the vehicle started heading towards Gerda Hill.

"Murray!" screamed a familiar voice. "Planning on leaving me behind?" Appearing from the dense sandstorm was a forgotten face, "James Gunn", a retired veteran, and more importantly, Murray's childhood best friend.
