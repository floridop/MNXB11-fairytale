"I think we're done here" - said Xa-aX while returning in her pocket
the TikTok Broadcaster after recording the report. 

As she was doing so, a sudden ray of lighting reflected over the 
Fox Interstellar News logo on the device, blasting instant light on 
Zo-oZ's terrified expression. 

"I can believe what we've just seen" - said Zo-oZ - "I hope I will 
manage to get some sleep tonight..."

"I will" - replied Xa-aX - " it ain't the first time I record this 
stuff. I thought you said you were used to it!"

"Did I say...? Oh sure, sure! I've seen this before, no problem!" - 
answered Zo-oZ in a mix of shame and confusion.

As they stepped into the company's instaporter, they heard footsteps approaching from their right. They turned and saw the face of the woman they had been dreading to see all day.
