 Burning SailWheels : A collaborative story
-------------------------------------------

They could see the sandstorm approaching on the horizon as the noon sun
started to hit its 52+ degrees out there.

From the top of Gerda Hill the WheatherShield started charging, converging 
its rays into a semisphere that would protect the area for a radius of 50km. 

A view only possible from Finn hill some 20km away from the other
hill, were the SailTyres bar stood. A must stop for all the Wheelsailers
of the area.

"Do you think it will hiccup again this time?"

"I really hope it won't, this windstorm is going to be memorable. Expect
the weirdest stuff to fly around"

The weather had been like that for almost 20 years after the waters
retired, leaving large acres of land as a desert, and only
hills here and there where populated by living creatures, biological or not.

Cyclops, piles of goo or a mix of the once existing creatures of the past could be seen. Dangerous or not, nobody wanted to find out. Everything was the result of the radiation of the last nuclear wars, so the creatures didn't even worked as food. 

Most of these creatures could survive with the least of water.

The biomechanical ones would search for other energy sources depending on their design.

Some theorized that one could follow these biomechanical creatures tracks to water power plants in order to find water. 

Sadly however, water powered energy was a thing of the past. Only the unresting sun
and the terrible winds were left.

As the thickness of the sandstorm made the sky dark, they didn't 
really realize what shape the last shadow casted on the windows 
of the bar.

Last scream they heard was a "WHAT THE H-" by the sweaty guy sitting by
the window. That's when a full-fledged container truck from the
pre-dry era fell from the sky smashing the bar at a crazy speed
destroying half of the building.

It happened again. The WheatherShield shut down for a moment, and
just for enough time for the extraordinary object to close the
establishment for an indefinite amount of time.
Although this events could be expected, they were hard to predict.
Murray was still frantically messing up with his Sailwheel control
panel when he saw the whole event unfolding in front of his eyes.
Saving these people was not exactly their business. They weren't 
there for the bar either.

"Well" - they thought - "I guess it's really time to go check that
Weathershield now"
It took a few minutes to check all the onboard controls.
Sealed the airlock, opened the Sail, and the wheels screamed
as the vehicle started heading towards Gerda Hill,
up and down over the sandy dunes.

The WeatherShields were built before the drying event, to combat different 
weather anomalies. But what was once an anomaly has now become the 
new climate -  and old tech can not keep up with it. 

"Murray!" screamed a familiar voice. "Planning on leaving me behind?" Appearing from the dense sandstorm was a forgotten face, "James Gunn", a retired veteran, and more importantly, Murray's childhood best friend.

The storms created can be of a violent nature. Not like any storm planet Earth has seen before. The WeatherShield was developed to prevent disasters from happening, but it is far from perfect since it is a human made technology. While most things are built by AI, the only well made WeatherSheild is built by man. 
As Murray speeded towards Gerda Hill in his vehicle, he couldn't shake 
the nagging feeling that something wasn't right. He couldn't help but 
wonder if the incident at the SailTyres bar was a mere coincidence or 
a part of a larger puzzle.

As Murray's vehicle sped towards Gerda Hill, the sandstorm raged around them, making the journey treacherous. The air was thick with swirling sand, reducing visibility to almost zero. The mighty winds howled, and the temperature soared, making the inside of the vehicle feel like an oven.
As the vehicle moved forward against the strong winds carrying waves of abraisive sand. Small cracks began  to appear in the glass.The silouhuette of the WeatherShield, only visible as a small black dot on the horizon, seemed so far away.

In the roaring wind the destination quickly grew closer as the thunder of debris smashing against the Weathershield increased in intensity.

Then suddently, the vehicle sighed as it stopped abruptly.

They flew across the sands, swirving to avoid the large mechanical constructs roaming the desolate plains.
